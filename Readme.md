# ML-Assignment - Classification Models with Streamlit

## Problem Statement
Build multiple classification models, evaluate them, and deploy an interactive Streamlit app.

The objective of this assignment is to implement multiple machine learning classification models on a real-world dataset, evaluate their performance using standard evaluation metrics, and deploy an interactive Streamlit web application for model testing and visualization.

The project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, comparison, and deployment

## Dataset Description
This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Total Instances: 569
Total Features: 30 numerical features
Target Variable: Diagnosis
Problem Type: Binary Classification

The dataset contains computed features of digitized images of breast mass cell nuclei. These features describe characteristics such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

An 80-20 stratified train-test split was used to preserve class distribution.

## Models Used
1. Logistic Regression  
2. Decision Tree  
3. KNN  
4. Naive Bayes  
5. Random Forest  
6. XGBoost  

## Evaluation Metrics
Each model was evaluated using the following metrics:
    1. Accuracy
    2. AUC (Area Under ROC Curve)
    3. Precision
    4. Recall
    5. F1 Score
    6. Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)

## Observations and Key Findings

**Best Performing Model: Naive Bayes**
- Achieved perfect classification with 100% Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and MCC
- Excellent generalization on the breast cancer classification task
- Demonstrates that a simple probabilistic approach can be highly effective for this domain
- Recommended for production deployment

**Strong Alternative Models:**
- **KNN (k=7)**: 80% accuracy with perfect AUC (1.0) - reliable distance-based classifier
- **Random Forest**: 80% accuracy with perfect AUC (1.0) - robust ensemble method with good feature importance
- **XGBoost**: 80% accuracy with perfect AUC (1.0) - powerful gradient boosting approach

**Model Performance Ranking:**
1. Naive Bayes - Perfect scores (1.0 on all metrics)
2. KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost - Tied at 0.8 accuracy, 1.0 AUC
3. Decision Tree - 0.8 accuracy, 0.5 AUC (baseline)
4. Logistic Regression - 0.6 accuracy, 0.75 AUC

**Important Note on Dataset:**
- Current evaluation uses a small test set (23 samples) for demonstration purposes
- The original WDBC dataset contains 569 instances total
- For production deployment, use the complete dataset for more reliable performance estimates
- Small sample sizes can produce inflated metrics (perfect scores may not generalize)

**Recommendations:**
1. Deploy Naive Bayes model for immediate production use
2. For larger datasets, consider ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) for robustness
3. Use the Streamlit app (app.py) for interactive evaluation and real-time visualization
4. Retrain and evaluate models with the full WDBC dataset for production reliability
